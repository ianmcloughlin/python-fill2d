# 2D fill plots in Python
This simple PYthon script shows you how to fill in the area between two lines on a 2D plot using Python's matplotlib module.
It plots two lines, cos(x) and sin(x), and then fills in the space between each of them and the x-axis.
rgba colours are used.

## Exercises

1. Fill in the area between six(x) and cos(x).

2. Use rgba colours for the line colours in the plot commands.

3. Plot cos squared and sin squared instead.

4. Instead of filling the area between cos squared and the x axis, fill the area between sin squared, and sin squared plus cos squared.
